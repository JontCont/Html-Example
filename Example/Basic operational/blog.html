			<h3>Blog title</h3>

			<p>A blog (a truncation of "weblog")is a discussion or informational website published 
			on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts).
			Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first,
			at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual,
			occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s,
			"multi-author blogs" emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and 
			sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities,
			think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic.
			The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate 
			MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or
			add content to a blog.</p>
